(currently editing description)

Along with my partner, I designed the data structures for and implemented a relational database management system (DBMS), with a domain specific language (DSL) for user interaction. This project was part of UC Berkeley course CS61B: Data Structures.

We created table structures and implemented commands for create, load, store, delete, print, insert into, and select. Implementing table joins was the most difficult part of this project.

The DSL allowed string, int, and float types as data in the tables. We implemented command parsing, allowing for column expressions, arithmetic operators and comparators, and conditional expressions within a command.

Unfortunately, the code is not available to the public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj2/proj2.html) on the CS61B Spring 2017 course page.
