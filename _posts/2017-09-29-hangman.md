(currently editing description)

This project was made for UC Berkeley's iOS DeCal. However, apart from a list of phrases (locations in Berkeley), I coded the entire project from scratch. I also added my own drawings for graphics.

Below are several images of the finished product: (insert screenshots)

Unfortunately, the code is not available to the public. However, the project spec can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/iosdecal/hw2).
