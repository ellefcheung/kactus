I created two implementations of a double ended queue (aka a deque), one with Java's LinkedList class and one with Java's ArrayList class. This project was for UC Berkeley's course CS61B: Data Structures.

Unfortunately, the code for this project is not available to the public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj1a/proj1a.html) on the CS61B Spring 2017 course page.
