(currently editing description)

I created the server backend for this mapping interface for UC Berkeley's course CS61B: Data Structures. The frontend was previously implemented for us.

I primarily implemented three classes: Rasterer, GraphDB, and Router. Rasterer, which I implemented as a quadtree structure, was used to render files to find the correct map area to display whenever the user scrolled or zoomed. In GraphDB, I parsed map data and created the graph representations to store, with nodes as intersections and edges as road sections between them. In the Router class, I implemented A* graph search to find the shortest path from any given point A to point B on the map.

Unfortunately, the code is not available to the public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](http://datastructur.es/sp17/materials/proj/proj3/proj3.html) on the CS61B Spring 2017 course page.
