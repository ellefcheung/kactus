The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Summer 2015 Women's Technology Program was my first introduction to electrical engineering and computer science. Building a working tetris game was our final coding project. I worked with Victoria Chen to build and create this program.

We used object-oriented programming to build classes first for an individual block, then a shape, then for each of the different seven tetrominoes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z). We also built a class Board to store the states at any given time.

We used a graphics module to listen for key events and interpret them into Python 2 such that pressing the left, right, or down arrows moves the current shape accordingly, pressing the up arrow rotates the shape, and pressing the spacebar drops the shape.

Later on my own, I added several other functionalities to the game.

I added another key event such that pressing "P" pauses the game.

I also added a scoreboard which increases player level every thousand points, where points are earned by filling and eliminating a row.

Below are several images of the finished product:
