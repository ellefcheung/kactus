The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Summer 2015 Women's Technology Program was my first introduction to electrical engineering and computer science. Building a working tetris game was our final coding project.

I used object-oriented programming to build classes first for an individual block, then a shape, then for each of the different seven tetrominoes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z). I also built a class Board to store the states at any given time.

I used a graphics module to listen for key events and interpret them into Python 2 such that pressing the left, right, or down arrows moves the current shape accordingly, pressing the up arrow rotates the shape, pressing the spacebar drops the shape, and pressing "P" pauses the game.

Below are several images of the finished product:

The code for this project, including specifics regarding the graphics module I used, can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/ellefcheung/tetris).
