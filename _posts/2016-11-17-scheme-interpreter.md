I created a scheme interpreter using Python 3 for UC Berkeley's course CS61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Some functional implementations include the interpreter's ability to read, parse, and correctly evaluate simple mathematical statements, user-defined variables and procedures, and logical forms such as conditionals and propositional statements. It can also store and evaluate other special forms such as quote forms, linked lists, and dynamically scoped mu functions.

Unfortunately, the code I programmed for this project is not public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa16/proj/scheme/) on the CS61A Fall 2016 course page.
