(currently editing description)

I built a RISC-V assembly language disassembler and execution emulator for UC Berkeley's course CS61C: Great Ideas of Computer Architecture.

I implemented the accurate translation and execution of machine code for a subset of RISC-V instructions: types R: register, I: immediate, S: store, SB: branch, U: upper immediate, and UJ: jump.

Unfortunately, the code is not available to the public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su18/projs/02-1/) on the CS61C Summer 2018 course page.
