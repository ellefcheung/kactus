(currently editing description)

This project was for UC Berkeley's course CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

Constructed a binary perceptron and neural network models (NumPy) for CS188 (Intro to AI)
Perceptron: implemented ????????????????
Neural nets: implemented back propagation, ??????????????
Trained results on existing ____ datasets for weight and hyperparameter optimizations

Unfortunately, the code is not available to the public.
