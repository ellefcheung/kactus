(currently editing description)

This project was for UC Berkeley's course CS61C: Great Ideas of Computer Architecture.

I used [logism-evolution] (https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution), a digital logic designer simulator, to design a RISC-V subset CPU. I constructed the control and datapath from scratch, abstracting parts into different sub-circuits. Several parts of the datapath I implemented include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), register file (RegFile), immediate generator, and branch comparator. After creating a functional single stage CPU, I added registers for a 2-stage pipelined CPU with Instruction Fetch and Execute stages, and accordingly implemented instruction kills to handle jump and branching hazards.

Unfortunately, the design is not available to the public. However, the complete project spec can be found [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su18/projs/03/) on the CS61C Summer 2018 course page.
