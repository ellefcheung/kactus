About Me
=========

I'm a second-year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley.

This website (currently under construction) will be hosting some of my projects and artworks.

If you are interested, please don't hesitate to reach out and contact me! (I am currently searching for Summer 2018 internship opportunities).
